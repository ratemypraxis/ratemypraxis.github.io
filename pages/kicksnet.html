        Kicksnet? What's that?

        Kicknet is a fork of the Sneaket protocol which aims to bring community stewardship values & cybersecurity principles to knowledge sharing systems 
        for over-suveillance & censored communities. This instance of the project is paticulaly concerned with providing a safe & useful space for LGBTQ 
        youth & students of color in light of recent legislation in the U.S. State of Florida (and Texas) that aims to criminalize queer and trans histories as 
        well as critical race theory in education.

            What's a Sneakernet?
          </h1>
          <p class="textBox" style="padding: 15px; font-size: 18px;">
            A Sneakernet is an offline protocol for sharing information. In short, running a Sneakernet is as simple as putting your sneakers on and 
            meeting up with a friend to physically hand them the data you want to share. As simple as the concept sounds there are some really large & complex use-cases of it globally,
            for example El Paquete Semenal in Cuba which distributes a terabyte of data to millions of Cubans every week, supplying them with a bunch of digital media in light of low rates of internet access.

            What's the difference between Kicksnet & base Sneakernet?
          </h1>
          <p class="textBox" style="padding: 15px; font-size: 18px;">
            Well Kicksnet <em>is</em> a Sneakernet just with a few intentional features that make it more ideal for a specific use-case - sharing sensitive information
            among within vulnerable communities. By setting up trusted access points with local community spaces, equiping data carriers with secure moderation software & basing the whole project 
            on a highly collaborative open community guidelines document, Kicksnet aims to be a mode of sharing that is by & for the people who need it most.
